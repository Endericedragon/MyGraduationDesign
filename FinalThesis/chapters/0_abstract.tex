2008年，随着中本聪发布《Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System》论文，区块链技术横空出世，并迅速以其去中心化、不可篡改等特点，迅速博得了大量行业的青睐。目前，区块链技术已经在数字货币、车联网等领域取得了亮眼的成绩。然而，传统区块链采用单链结构，每个区块仅存储上一个区块的哈希信息，在需要应对大吞吐量的工况下，容易因链条过长导致性能下降；此外，在应用于车联网这一场景下时，由于区块并未按照地理位置存储，而车辆节点需要关心的信息大多来自临近区域的区块数据，故可能需要耗费诸多不必要的查询开销。

为解决上述两个问题，“树状区块链”应运而生。在树状区块链中，区块被分为分支区块和叶子区块两种。叶子区块和传统的区块链并无太大差异，而分支区块则负责将数个叶子区块组织起来，按照叶子区块所代表的地理位置，结合GeoHash编码技术形成类似于字典树的树状结构。由于树状结构相比单链结构的深度更小，且采用了与地理位置相关的GeoHash进行分支构造，故有望为上述两个问题提供合理的解决方案。

本课题首先研究树状区块链相较传统链式区块链的优势与局限性；其次，以出租车调度系统为背景，测试树状区块链和传统链式区块链在运行该调度系统时的性能表现差异；最后，讨论将现有树状区块链的运行平台由以太坊支持的以太坊虚拟机（EVM）迁移至兼容性更广、性能更佳的Web Assembly平台上的优势及可行性，并进行部分迁移工作加以佐证。

In 2008, with the release of Satoshi Nakamoto's "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" paper, blockchain technology came into the world, and quickly with its decentralized, tamper-free characteristics, quickly won the favor of a large number of industries. At present, blockchain technology has made remarkable achievements in digital currency, Internet of vehicles and other fields. However, the traditional blockchain adopts the single-chain structure, and each block only stores the hash information of the previous block. Under the working condition of large throughput, the performance is likely to be degraded due to the long chain. In addition, when applied to the scenario of the Internet of vehicles, because the block is not stored according to the geographical location, and most of the information that the vehicle node needs to care about is from the block data in the adjacent area, it may consume a lot of unnecessary query costs.

To solve the above two problems, "tree-like blockchain" came into being. In a tree-like blockchain, blocks are divided into branch blocks and leaf blocks. The leaf block is not very different from the traditional blockchain, while the branch block is responsible for organizing several leaf blocks, according to the geographical location of the leaf block, combined with GeoHash coding technology to form a tree structure similar to dictionary tree. Due to the smaller depth of the tree structure compared to the single chain structure and the use of GeoHash for branch construction, it is expected to provide a reasonable solution to the above two problems.

Based on the laboratory's existing work "tree-like blockchain", this topic studies the advantages and limitations of tree blockchain compared with traditional blockchain. Taking the taxi dispatching system as the background, we test the performance differences between the tree blockchain and the traditional blockchain when running the dispatching system. Finally, the advantages and feasibility of migrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supported by Ethereum to the Web Assembly platform with wider compatibility and better performance are discussed, and some migration work is carried out to prove it.
